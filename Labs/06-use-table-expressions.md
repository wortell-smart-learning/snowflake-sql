# Create queries with table expressions

In this lab, you'll use table expressions to query the **adventureworks** database. For your reference, the following diagram shows the tables in the database (you may need to resize the pane to see them clearly).

## Create a view

You use the CREATE VIEW statement to create a view.

1. SCeate a new worksheet and connect to the database en warehouse

1. Let's fetch some data. Enter the following query to retrieve all products that are classified as road bikes (*ProductCategoryID=6*) from the **SalesLT.Products** table:

    ```
    SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice
    FROM SalesLT.Product
    WHERE ProductCategoryID = 6;
    ```

1. Select **&#x23f5;Run** to run your query.

1. The query returned all products that are categorized as road bikes. But what if you wanted to use a view for this data to ensure applications don't need to access the underlying table to fetch it? Replace your previous code with the code shown below:

    ```
    CREATE VIEW SalesLT.vProductsRoadBikes AS
    SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice
    FROM SalesLT.Product
    WHERE ProductCategoryID = 6;
    ```

1. This code creates a view called **vProductsRoadBikes** for all road bikes. Select **&#x23f5;Run** to run the code and create the view.

## Query a view

You've created your view. Now you can use it. For example, you can use your view to get a list of any road bikes based on their **ListPrice**.

1. In the query editor, replace the code you entered previously with the following code:

    ```
    SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice
    FROM SalesLT.vProductsRoadBikes
    WHERE ListPrice < 1000;
    ```

1. Select **&#x23f5;Run**.

1. Review the results. You've queried your view and retrieved a list of any road bikes that have a **ListPrice** under 1000. Your query uses your view as a source for the data. This means your applications can use your view for specific searches like this, and won't need to access the underlying table to fetch the data they need.

## Use a derived table

Sometimes you might end up having to rely on complex queries. You can use derived tables in place of those complex queries to avoid adding to their complexity.

1. In the query editor, replace the code you entered previously with the following code:

    ```
    SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice,
           CASE WHEN ListPrice > 1000 THEN 'High' ELSE 'Normal' END AS PriceType
    FROM SalesLT.Product;
    ```

1. Select **&#x23f5;Run**.

1. The query calculates whether the price of a product is considered high or normal. But you'd like to be able to further build on this query based on additional criteria, without further adding to its complexity. In order to do this, you can create a derived table for it. Replace the previous code with the code below:

    ```
    SELECT DerivedTable.ProductID, DerivedTable.Name, DerivedTable.ListPrice
    FROM
        (
            SELECT
            ProductID, Name, ListPrice,
            CASE WHEN ListPrice > 1000 THEN 'High' ELSE 'Normal' END AS PriceType
            FROM SalesLT.Product
        ) AS DerivedTable
    WHERE DerivedTable.PriceType = 'High';
    ```

1. Select **&#x23f5;Run**.

1. You've created derived table based on your previous query.  Your new code uses that derived table and fetches the **ProductID**, **Name**, and **ListPrice** of products that have a **PriceType** of *High* only. Your derived table enabled you to easily build on top of your initial query based on your additional criteria, without making the initial query any more complex.

## Challenges

Now it's your turn to use table expressions.

> **Tip**: Try to determine the appropriate code for yourself. If you get stuck, suggested answers are provided at the end of this lab.

### Challenge 1: Create a view

Adventure Works is forming a new sales team located in Canada. The team wants to create a map of all of the customer addresses in Canada. This team will need access to address details on Canadian customers only. Your manager has asked you to make sure that the team can get the data they require, but ensure that they don't access the underlying source data when getting their information.

To carry out the task do the following:

1. Write a SQL query to create a view for customer addresses in Canada.
   - Create a view based on the following columns in the **SalesLT.Address** table:
      - **AddressLine1**
      - **City**
      - **StateProvince**
      - **CountryRegion**
   - In your query, use the **CountryRegion** column to filter for addresses located in *Canada* only.

1. Query your new view.
   - Fetch the rows in your newly created view to ensure it was created successfully. Notice that it only shows address in Canada.

### Challenge 2: Use a derived table

The transportation team at Adventure Works wants to optimize its processes. Products that weigh more than 1000 are considered to be heavy products, and will also need to use a new transportation method if their list price is over 2000. You've been asked to classify products according to their weight, and then provide a list of products that meet both these weight and list price criteria.

To help, you'll:

1. Write a query that classifies products as heavy and normal based on their weight.
   - Use the **Weight** column to decide whether a product is heavy or normal.

1. Create a derived table based on your query
   - Use your derived table to find any heavy products with a list price over 2000.
   - Make sure to select the following columns: **ProductID, Name, Weight, ListPrice**.

## Challenge Solutions

This section contains suggested solutions for the challenge queries.

### Challenge 1

1. Write a Transact-SQL query to create a view for customer addresses in Canada.

    ```
    CREATE VIEW SalesLT.vAddressCA AS
    SELECT AddressLine1, City, StateProvince, CountryRegion
    FROM SalesLT.Address
    WHERE CountryRegion = 'Canada';
    ```

1. Query your new view.

    ```
    SELECT * FROM SalesLT.vAddressCA;
    ```

### Challenge 2

1. Write a query that classifies products as heavy and normal based on their weight.

    ```
    SELECT ProductID, Name, Weight, ListPrice,
           CASE WHEN Weight > 1000 THEN 'Heavy' ELSE 'Normal' END AS WeightType
    FROM SalesLT.Product;
    ```

1. Create a derived table based on your query.

    ```
    SELECT DerivedTable.ProductID, DerivedTable.Name, DerivedTable.Weight, DerivedTable.ListPrice
    FROM
        (
            SELECT ProductID, Name, Weight, ListPrice,
                   CASE WHEN Weight > 1000. THEN 'Heavy' ELSE 'Normal' END AS WeightType
            FROM SalesLT.Product
        ) AS DerivedTable
    WHERE DerivedTable.WeightType = 'Heavy' AND DerivedTable.ListPrice > 2000;
    ```
