# Implement error handling with Snowflake SQL

In this lab, you'll use Snowflake SQL statements to test various error handling techniques in the **adventureworks** database. For your reference, the following diagram shows the tables in the database (you may need to resize the pane to see them clearly).

> **Note**: If you're familiar with the standard **AdventureWorks** sample database, you may notice that in this lab we are using a simplified version that makes it easier to focus on learning Snowflake SQL syntax.

## Write a basic TRY/CATCH construct

1. Start Azure Data Studio
2. From the Servers pane, double-click the **AdventureWorks connection**. A green dot will appear when the connection is successful.
3. Right click the AdventureWorks connection and select **New Query**. A new query window is displayed with a connection to the AdventureWorks database.
4. The previous step will open a query screen that is connected to the TSQL database.
5. In the query pane, type the following T-SQL code:

```
SELECT CAST(N'Some text' AS int);
```

6. Select **&#x23f5;Run** to run the code.
7. Notice the conversion error:

   | Result|
   |-------|
   | Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value 'Some text' to data type int. |

8. Write a TRY/CATCH construct. Your T-SQL code should look like this:

```
BEGIN TRY
    SELECT CAST(N'Some text' AS int);
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Error';
END CATCH;
```

9. Run the modified code, and review the response. The results should include no rows, and the **Messages** tab should include the text **Error**.

## Display an error number and an error message

1. Right click the AdventureWorks connection and select New Query
2. Enter the following T-SQL code:

```
DECLARE @num varchar(20) = '0';

BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 5. / CAST(@num AS numeric(10,4));
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH

END CATCH;
```

3. Select **&#x23f5;Run**. Notice that you didn't get an error because you used the TRY/CATCH construct.
4. Modify the T-SQL code by adding two PRINT statements. The T-SQL code should look like this:

```
DECLARE @num varchar(20) = '0';

BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 5. / CAST(@num AS numeric(10,4));
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Error Number: ' + CAST(ERROR_NUMBER() AS varchar(10));
    PRINT 'Error Message: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
```

5. Run the modified code, and notice that an error is produced, but it's one that you defined.

   | Started executing query at line 1 |
   | ------ |
   | Error Number: 8134 |
   | Error Message: Divide by zero error encountered. |

6. Now change the value of the @num variable to look like this:

```
DECLARE @num varchar(20) = 'A';
```

7. Run the modified code. Notice that you get a different error number and message.

   | Started executing query at line 1 |
   | ------ |
   | Error Message: Error converting data type varchar to numeric.|
   | Error Number: 8114 |

8. Change the value of the @num variable to look like this:

```
DECLARE @num varchar(20) = ' 1000000000';
```

9. Run the modified code. Notice that you get a different error number and message.

   | Started executing query at line 1 |
   | ------ |
   | Error Number: 8115 |
   | Error Message: Arithmetic overflow error converting varchar to data type numeric. |

## Add conditional logic to a CATCH block

1. Modify the T-SQL code you used previously so it looks like this:

```
DECLARE @num varchar(20) = 'A';

BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 5. / CAST(@num AS numeric(10,4));
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    IF ERROR_NUMBER() IN (245, 8114)
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Handling conversion error...'
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN 
        PRINT 'Handling non-conversion error...';
    END;

    PRINT 'Error Number: ' + CAST(ERROR_NUMBER() AS varchar(10));
    PRINT 'Error Message: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
```

2. Run the modified code.  You'll see that message returned now contains more information:

   | Started executing query at line 1 |
   | ------ |
   | Handling conversion error...|
   | Error Number: 8114 |
   | Error Message: Error converting data type varchar to numeric.|

3. Change the value of the @num variable to look like this:

```
DECLARE @num varchar(20) = '0';
```

4. Run the modified code. This produces a different type of error message:

   | Started executing query at line 1 |
   | ------ |
   | Handling non-conversion error...|
   | Error Number: 8134 |
   | Error Message: Divide by zero error encountered. |

## Create a stored procedure to display an error message

1. Right click the AdventureWorks connection and select New Query
2. Enter the following T-SQL code:

```
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.GetErrorInfo AS
PRINT 'Error Number: ' + CAST(ERROR_NUMBER() AS varchar(10));
PRINT 'Error Message: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
PRINT 'Error Severity: ' + CAST(ERROR_SEVERITY() AS varchar(10));
PRINT 'Error State: ' + CAST(ERROR_STATE() AS varchar(10));
PRINT 'Error Line: ' + CAST(ERROR_LINE() AS varchar(10));
PRINT 'Error Proc: ' + COALESCE(ERROR_PROCEDURE(), 'Not within procedure');
```

3. Select **&#x23f5;Run**. to run the code, which creates a stored procedure named **dbo.GetErrorInfo**.
4. Return to the query that previously resulted in a "Divide by zero" error, and modify it as follows:

```
DECLARE @num varchar(20) = '0';

BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 5. / CAST(@num AS numeric(10,4));
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    EXECUTE dbo.GetErrorInfo;
END CATCH;
```

5. Run the code.  This will trigger the stored procedure and display:

   | Started executing query at line 1 |
   | ------ |
   | Error Number: 8134|
   | Error Message: Divide by zero error encountered.|
   | Error Severity: 16|
   | Error State: 1|
   | Error Line: 4|
   | Error Proc: Not within procedure|

## Rethrow the Existing Error Back to a Client

1. Modify the CATCH block of your code to include a THROW command, so that your code looks like this:

```
DECLARE @num varchar(20) = '0';

BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 5. / CAST(@num AS numeric(10,4));
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    EXECUTE dbo.GetErrorInfo; 
    THROW;
END CATCH;
```

2. Run the modified code.  Here you'll see that it executes the stored procedure, and then throws the error message again (so a client application can catch and process it).

   | Started executing query at line 1 |
   | ------ |
   | Error Number: 8134|
   | Error Message: Divide by zero error encountered.|
   | Error Severity: 16|
   | Error State: 1|
   | Error Line: 4|
   | Error Proc: Not within procedure|
   | Msg 8134, Level 16, State 1, Line 4|
   | Divide by zero error encountered.|

## Add an Error Handling Routine

1. Modify your code to look like this:

```
DECLARE @num varchar(20) = 'A';

BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 5. / CAST(@num AS numeric(10,4));
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    EXECUTE dbo.GetErrorInfo;
    
    IF ERROR_NUMBER() = 8134
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Handling devision by zero...';
    END
    ELSE 
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Throwing original error';
        THROW;
    END;
    
END CATCH;
```

2. Run the modified code  As you'll see, it executes the stored procedure to display the error, identifies that it isn't error number 8134, and throws the error again.

   | Started executing query at line 1 |
   | ------ |
   | Error Number: 8114|
   | Error Message: Error converting data type varchar to numeric.|
   | Error Severity: 16|
   | Error State: 5|
   | Error Line: 5|
   | Error Proc: Not within procedure|
   | Throwing original error|
   | Msg 8114, Level 16, State 5, Line 5|
   | Error converting data type varchar to numeric.|

## Challenges

Now it's time to try using what you've learned.

> **Tip**: Try to determine the appropriate solutions for yourself. If you get stuck, suggested answers are provided at the end of this lab.

### Challenge 1: Catch errors and display only valid records

The marketing manager is using the following T-SQL query, but they are getting unexpected results. They have asked you to make the code more resilient, to stop it crashing and to not display duplicates when there is no data.

```
DECLARE @customerID AS INT = 30110;
DECLARE @fname AS NVARCHAR(20);
DECLARE @lname AS NVARCHAR(30);
DECLARE @maxReturns AS INT = 1; 

WHILE @maxReturns <= 10
BEGIN
    SELECT @fname = FirstName, @lname = LastName FROM SalesLT.Customer
        WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID;
    PRINT @fname + N' ' + @lname;
    SET @maxReturns += 1;
    SET @CustomerID += 1;
END;
```

1. Catch the error
    - Add a TRY .. CATCH block around the SELECT query.
2. Warn the user that an error has occurred
    - Extend your TSQL code to display a warning to the user that their is an error.
3. Only display valid customer records
    - Extend the T-SQL using the @@ROWCOUNT > 0 check to only display a result if the customer ID exists.

### Challenge 2: Create a simple error display procedure

Error messages and error handling are essential for good code. Your manager has asked you to develop a common error display procedure.  Use this sample code as your base.

```
DECLARE @num varchar(20) = 'Challenge 2';

PRINT 'Casting: ' + CAST(@num AS numeric(10,4));
```

1. Catch the error
   - Add a TRY...CATCH around the PRINT statement.
2. Create a stored procedure
   - Create a stored procedure called dbo.DisplayErrorDetails.  It should display a title and the value for **ERROR_NUMBER**, **ERROR_MESSAGE** and **ERROR_SEVERITY**.
3. Display the error information
   - Use the stored procedure to display the error information when an error occurs.

## Challenge Solutions

This section contains suggested solutions for the challenge queries.

### Challenge 1

1. Catch the error

```
DECLARE @customerID AS INT = 30110;
DECLARE @fname AS NVARCHAR(20);
DECLARE @lname AS NVARCHAR(30);
DECLARE @maxReturns AS INT = 1;

WHILE @maxReturns <= 10
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRY
        SELECT @fname = FirstName, @lname = LastName FROM SalesLT.Customer
            WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID;

        PRINT CAST(@customerID as NVARCHAR(20)) + N' ' + @fname + N' ' + @lname;
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH

    END CATCH;

    SET @maxReturns += 1;
    SET @CustomerID += 1;
END;
```

2. Warn the user that an error has occurred

```
DECLARE @customerID AS INT = 30110;
DECLARE @fname AS NVARCHAR(20);
DECLARE @lname AS NVARCHAR(30);
DECLARE @maxReturns AS INT = 1;

WHILE @maxReturns <= 10
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRY
        SELECT @fname = FirstName, @lname = LastName FROM SalesLT.Customer
            WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID;

            PRINT CAST(@customerID as NVARCHAR(20)) + N' ' + @fname + N' ' + @lname;
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        PRINT 'Unable to run query'
    END CATCH;

    SET @maxReturns += 1;
    SET @CustomerID += 1;
END;
```

3. Only display valid customer records

```
DECLARE @customerID AS INT = 30110;
DECLARE @fname AS NVARCHAR(20);
DECLARE @lname AS NVARCHAR(30);
DECLARE @maxReturns AS INT = 1;

WHILE @maxReturns <= 10
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRY
        SELECT @fname = FirstName, @lname = LastName FROM SalesLT.Customer
            WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID;

        IF @@ROWCOUNT > 0 
        BEGIN
            PRINT CAST(@customerID as NVARCHAR(20)) + N' ' + @fname + N' ' + @lname;
        END
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        PRINT 'Unable to run query'
    END CATCH

    SET @maxReturns += 1;
    SET @CustomerID += 1;
END;
```

### Challenge 2

1. Catch the error

```
DECLARE @num varchar(20) = 'Challenge 2';

BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 'Casting: ' + CAST(@num AS numeric(10,4));
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH

END CATCH;
```

2. Create a stored procedure

```
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.DisplayErrorDetails AS
PRINT 'ERROR INFORMATION';
PRINT 'Error Number: ' + CAST(ERROR_NUMBER() AS varchar(10));
PRINT 'Error Message: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
PRINT 'Error Severity: ' + CAST(ERROR_SEVERITY() AS varchar(10));
```

3. Display the error information

```
DECLARE @num varchar(20) = 'Challenge 2';

BEGIN TRY
    PRINT 'Casting: ' + CAST(@num AS numeric(10,4));
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    EXECUTE dbo.DisplayErrorDetails;
END CATCH;
```
